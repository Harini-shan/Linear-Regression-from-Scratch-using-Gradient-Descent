# ðŸ“‰ Linear Regression from Scratch using Gradient Descent

This project demonstrates how to implement **Linear Regression** without using any machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`. Instead, it uses **pure Python and NumPy**, applying **gradient descent** to learn the optimal parameters.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Implements linear regression using:
  - `(2/n)` gradient method (from standard MSE)
  - `(-1/n)` gradient method (from scaled MSE)
- âœ… Compares both gradient methods visually
- âœ… Shows how the choice of loss function affects gradient calculation
- âœ… No external ML libraries used (fully from scratch)
- âœ… Includes detailed graph output for better understanding
